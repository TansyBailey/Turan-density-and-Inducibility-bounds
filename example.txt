The following is an example of a Turan density problem, F = 3-graph K_4^- :

F = [IncidenceStructure(4,[[0,1,2],[0,2,3],[0,1,3]])]
main_function(3,4,F,[],'D')


And an example of an inducibility problem, P = 3-graph on 4 vertices with 1 edge: 

P = [IncidenceStructure(4,[[1,2,3]])]
main_function(3,4,[],P,'I')
